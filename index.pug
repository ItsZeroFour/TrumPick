                  | Often, we misunderstand the term &apos;balanced nutrition.&apos;
                  | Most people genuinely try to adhere to dietary principles
                  | that they believe are correct. However, current nutrition
                  | science, based on peer-reviewed articles, academic
                  | literature, human physiology, chemistry, and sociology,
                  | has formulated fundamental principles and approaches
                  | related to real criteria for balanced nutrition. These may

                  | doctor, author of popular books, and so on, may think
                  | about nutrition. For this reason, you might see an
                  | evaluation that differs from what you expected. TrumPick&apos;s
                  | main goal is to help you improve your health and preserve
                  | youthfulness. You will see these results through medical
                  | tests and subjective well-being. However, it&apos;s essential
                  | to be ready for a change in your daily diet. Initially, it
                  | might seem challenging. However, on days 20-60, when you
                  | observe clear positive results and get used to the new
                  | dietary style, it will become easy. balanced nutrition, as
                  | TrumPick suggests, consists of various ingredients and
                  | food groups that can be part of very delicious dishes. The
                  | main thing is your sincere and real desire to change your
                  | health and appearance for the better, not just pretending
                  | to make changes. In reality, it&apos;s a small effort leading
                  | to tremendous positive results. If, for social, cultural,
                  | or personal reasons, or due to a strong belief in certain
                  | arguments, you find it challenging to adhere to rational

                  | Yes, proper nutrition can play a crucial role in managing
                  | disease risks, even with the overwhelming majority of
                  | genetic predispositions. Although genetics can influence
                  | your susceptibility to some diseases, the principles of
                  | balanced nutrition generally play a decisive role, with
                  | few exceptions. This is true even for many active chronic
                  | diseases, often reported as having genetic foundations,
                  | which can be brought into remission. For instance, most
                  | cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis
                  | (&apos;cholesterol plaques&apos;), erectile dysfunction, type 2
                  | diabetes, hypertension, constipation, many types of
                  | cancer, and more, can be entirely preventable through
                  | nutrition. These diseases are the main causes of premature
                  | death, reduced comfort, and quality of life, and they
                  | consume significant resources for treatment. Compounds
                  | present in food either stimulate the action of genes
                  | leading to diseases or suppress them, preventing the onset
                  | of these diseases. Moreover, many diseases attributed to
                  | predominant genetic factors may not be truly genetic. They
                  | are often linked to dietary and lifestyle habits passed
                  | down from parents and grandparents, as well as prevailing
                  | habits in the society you live in. Changing behavior or
                  | being in the company of people with healthier habits can
                  | radically improve health, and diseases with presumed
                  | genetic predispositions may not develop. You can try using
                  | TrumPick and see how your test results and well-being
                  | change after a couple of months. TrumPick recommendations
                  | are designed not to harm you. If you don&apos;t see a clear and
                  | distinct result, you can simply return to your old habits
                  | and only adopt what you like from TrumPick&apos;s advice. In
                  | essence, if you are skeptical about the power of
                  | nutrition, start using TrumPick as an opportunity to try
                  | something new without additional investments. If this
                  | experience proves enjoyable over 2-3 months, you can

                  | compounds needed for the immune system to prevent and

                  | Global warming is an ongoing, long-term process of
                  | increasing temperatures on Earth. This creates favorable
                  | conditions for the emergence of global epidemics. As
                  | temperatures rise, bacteria, viruses, and fungi multiply
                  | more rapidly. Importantly, it increases their
                  | survivability at temperatures higher than that of the
                  | human body, making them more resistant to the body&apos;s
                  | immune response upon entry. For instance, if fungi learn
                  | to survive at temperatures above 36&deg;C (97&deg;F), they could
                  | become deadly to humans without existing medications.
                  | Currently, these types of fungi do not pose a threat to
                  | humans as they are destroyed by the body&apos;s temperature.
                  | With the current pace of global warming, such
                  | survivability for fungi may be reached within the next
                  | 20-35 years. The second issue associated with global
                  | warming is changes in the planet&apos;s water balance due to
                  | higher rates of evaporation of freshwater. As a result,
                  | soils lose fertility, and food becomes extremely expensive
                  | and less accessible. Climate change occurs due to the
                  | Earth&apos;s temperature increase caused by the influence of
                  | greenhouse gases. The Earth absorbs sunlight and then
                  | radiates it as heat back into space. Greenhouse gases,
                  | including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone,
                  | are by-products of human and animal activities, including
                  | industrial and technological processes. These gases absorb
                  | the heat emitted by the Earth, slowing down its release
                  | into space. However, they do not impede the absorption of
                  | heat from a new batch of sunlight, leading to an overall
                  | increase in heat, and subsequently, a rise in Earth&apos;s
                  | temperature. There is a well-defined statistical link

                  | contributing to it. Generally, it is considered
                  | challenging to simultaneously slow down these emissions,
                  | given their connection to industries and transportation
                  | crucial for human quality of life. However, the food
                  | production sector, which is not essential for human
                  | well-being but increases the risk of diseases, is
                  | responsible for over 18% of greenhouse gas emissions. For
                  | example, the production of such food involves
                  | deforestation. Forests play a role in converting certain
                  | greenhouse gases into oxygen and prevent water loss.
                  | Without deforestation, increasing the production of such
                  | food is almost impossible due to a global shortage of
                  | suitable land. The popularity of such products is driven
                  | by marketing, leading to an increased demand. If more than
                  | 1/5 of the global population follows TrumPick&apos;s daily
                  | dietary recommendations, it will lead to the cessation of
                  | global warming. If more than 1/3 follows these
                  | recommendations within 5-6 years, the temperature will
                  | gradually return to an acceptable level within 30-40
                  | years. This transformation can happen without compromising
                  | the quality of life and income for the majority of the
                  | population. This is likely the optimal strategy for
                  | humanity since avoiding such products will lead to a
                  | significant reduction in the burden of chronic and
                  | infectious diseases and the cessation of global warming.
                  | Thus, your contribution to your own health is also your
                  | personal contribution to a beautiful and clean future for
                  | the Earth, free from the impacts of global warming due to
                  | sensible human actions

                  | negative health consequences (see details in the app).

                  | essential compounds on the &apos;Data&apos; or &apos;Menu&apos; page is around
                  | 100%, then a deficiency in compounds may only arise in
                  | relatively rare intestinal diseases or other organs, as
                  | well as extremely rare genetic conditions. Due to the lack
                  | of scientifically and statistically substantiated data
                  | indicating a positive effect of dietary supplements on
                  | Healthspan &amp; Youthspan, and disease prevention, very few
                  | centenarians consume any of them. TrumPick does not
                  | provide any recommendations on the choice of dietary
                  | supplements. If such data become available, they will be
                  | promptly accessible in TrumPick since the app&apos;s
                  | information is constantly updated with data relevant to
                  | your health and youthfulness. If you are certain that you
                  | need dietary supplements, it is advisable to seek advice
                  | from a physician who adheres to established treatment
                  | protocols and patient care. There are specific conditions
                  | and diseases where the use of dietary supplements is
                  | justified. However, the prescription of them should be
                  | based on a specific diagnosis, which is not determined by
                  | blood, hair analyses, etc., for vitamin and mineral
                  | deficiencies. If you are pregnant or planning pregnancy,
                  | depending on your region, a doctor may also prescribe
                  | dietary supplements such as iodine, folic acid, vitamin D.
                  | Often, these compounds represent a deficiency in many
                  | places on the planet. Therefore, such a prescription of
                  | dietary supplements can also be justified at the planning
                  | stage of conception and during pregnancy, including
                  | without undergoing analyses for deficiencies in these
                  | compounds. It is advisable to continue balanced nutrition
                  | according to TrumPick tips for pregnant women, along with
                  | following your doctor&apos;s instructions for taking these
